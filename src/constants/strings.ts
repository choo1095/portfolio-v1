      "I've been a mobile apps and web developer for the past three years, but my journey began elsewhere. I was an accounting student during my high school years, which continued into my undergraduate studies. I realized early on that it wasn't the right path for me and eventually pivoted to a career in development after persevering through and completing my accounting degree.",
      "I began my tech career with native iOS app development using Swift as a mobile application developer. I then transitioned to Flutter to meet the need for developing Android apps in addition to iOS. This shift allowed me to create hybrid apps for both platforms. While working with Flutter, I gradually delved into front-end development using Vue and Nuxt, expanding my experience with dynamic web design and user interfaces. This experience eventually led me to embrace full-stack development, where I now build comprehensive applications using Laravel, integrating both front-end and back-end technologies seamlessly.",
      "Throughout my journey, I've been experimenting with and exploring different programming languages, constantly broadening my technical knowledge, embracing new challenges along the way so that I can be a better version of myself every day.",
